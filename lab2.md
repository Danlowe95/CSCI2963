##Read the four criteria for Free Software

##Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

An open source license is important to ensure that your work is given proper credit and sourced when used by others. It can also help to ensure that any works derived from your code are also distributed as open-source projects (if using a copyleft license).  By having many projects utilize open source licensing, it allows for code to be usable by many people and more projects can appear that would not have been able to otherwise.


##Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license
If a project does not have a license, the code is "all-rights reserved" to the writer.  Utilizing code that is not licensed as open-source could get you in a lawsuit.

##Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of Why the Web beat Gopher


I agree with the claim that Gopher failed because of a lack of open-source development.  In the end, Gopher had a weaker workforce and was unable to get things done, and garner support, at the rate that the Web was able to due to crowdsourcing/open source.  The Web gained traction due to a large community contributing towards one project, working to improve the infrastructure that they themselves were using.


##Android uses the Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2, Linux uses the GPL v2 license, Microsoft .NET Core uses MIT license, SailfishOS is not open source.
##Can you justify why such a license is chosen (Justification for ONE is enough).

#SailfishOS
SailfishOS is primarily an open-source OS for phones, with the "benefit" that users can contribute to the OS and change it to how they want it.  Some parts of the OS, however, are not open source.  This includes many UI features and sme specific apps such as contacts, messaging, phone, etc.  It appears that users, if they so choose, could create all of these from scratch and use them instead of the proprietary version.  Sailfish (Jolla) made these proprietary as a source of revenue for their company, as a phone that is 100% open source would not generate revenue.  Most users appear ok with this, as the proprietary features were developed solely by Jolla and are replaceable by user created software.  There are projects (Nemo being one of them) that aim to create open-source versions of these features.


Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the LICENSE chooser by Github.

Utilizes the Apache License


Read these licenses GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use tldrlegal

The LGPL is useful for a developer looking for a library to utilize in his own project, because the LGPL does not require a developer to change the license of his work to fit that of the library he is including

The GPL is good for the common good.  It requires everything be open and code freely available to everyone

Apache is useful for companies who do not want release their newly updated code as it would hurt their profitability, but that still want to provide their code as open-source.  They can release the code, for example, an iteration behind.  This allows them to still release code to the public while still maintaining their ability to monetize.

#Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose.

I am working on IBEIS-Web and our user base is typically researchers.  We have chosen the Apache license because IBEIS itself uses the Apache license.  IBEIS-Web will utilize IBEIS and another open-source project, Wildbook, to create a usable interface for the program's users.
